## 📌 Overview
Contra Interior is a custom WordPress theme built for an architectural and interior design business.  
The original design was a static HTML template which I converted into a complete WordPress theme with dynamic content management using ACF Pro and custom post types.

This repository contains only the **theme code**—no WordPress core files or plugins.
